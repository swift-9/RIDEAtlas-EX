# RIDEAtlas-EX

🌍 **RIDEAtlas-EX** is my personal implementation of a modern, responsive React web application that uses the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to explore detailed data about countries around the world.  
Built with **React Router v7**, **TailwindCSS**, and a clean modular structure, this project was designed to be **developer-friendly, responsive, and ready for deployment**.

I built this project as part of my learning journey in frontend development — focusing on **clean UI/UX**, **state management**, and **API integration** — but you are free to fork, copy, and build upon it for your own purposes.
